We do also support [Guilded API Websocket events](https://www.guilded.gg/docs/api/websockets) (like `ChatMessageCreated`)

```
These events are hard to memorize ?
You have experience developing bots in discord.js ?

Don't worry,
Its very similar to the discord.js v13 event names. We do provide better typings for event names. So no need of scrubbing the docs
```

# We will finish this marvellous project soon ;)
